# k8s-setup-script

## Motivation

This guide will fully guide you through a setup process for getting a bare-metal kubernetes cluster up and running.

## Setup Order

This instructions in this guide are intended to be carried out in the following order:

- [Cluster Infrastructure Provisioning](./k8s-setup.md)
- [ArgoCD Installation](./argocd-setup.md)
- [Cert Manager](./cert-manager.md)
- [Nginx Ingress Controller](./nginx-ingress-controller.md)

At this point you can optionally follow the dashboard setup guide, which will give you a pretty good overview of the state of your cluster.

- [Kubernetes Dashboard](./dashboard-setup.md)
